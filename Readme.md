# Webpack: Just Give Me What I Fucking Need

*Pronounced: "Webpack Jigmawiffin"*

*Look, you want the kitchen sink, so here it is*

```sh
npm i -D webpack-jgmwifn
```

Webpack Jigmawiffin doesn’t include any executable code, it just installs the dependencies that you *always* fucking want:

- @babel/core
- @babel/preset-env
- @babel/preset-react
- bable-loader
- css-loader
- mini-css-extract-plugin
- postcss
- postcss-import
- postcss-loader
- style-loader
- webpack
- webpack-bundle-analyzer
- webpack-cli
- webpack-dev-server

You’re welcome.
